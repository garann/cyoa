<h2>You discover a mess</h2>

<p>It's been a year since you touched the first single-page application you ever wrote. You were just beginning to really understand the power of jQuery, and were excited to use it anywhere you could. When your product owner asked for a new feature, you complied happily, learning new tricks and adding new plugins.</p>
<p>Your application was a great success - good job! It's been in production ever since, making your company zillions of dollars. But now you need to add a new feature, and it's a crucial one. You open up the JavaScript again and exclaim aloud...</p>
<p>"Who the hell wrote this crap?!"</p>
<p>Oh, right, you did. In the past year you've learned a ton about best practices and code organization. None of this knowledge is in evidence when you review your old code. Shamed, you ask yourself what on earth to do now?</p>

<div class="choose">
	<a href="#2">If you decide to ignore the problem, turn to page 2.</a>
	<a href="#3">If you decide to rewrite the whole application from scratch, turn to page 3.</a>
	<a href="#4">If you decide to refactor, turn to page 4.</a>
