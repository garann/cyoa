<h2>Good choice.</h2>

<p>You know that if you ignore the problem it will keep getting worse and your website will become a ticking time bomb waiting to blow you to pieces. But starting over from scratch won't work, because none of the business logic in the application is documented and it's such a mess that at certain points it's not really clear what the code is doing. You could spend a lifetime getting it to work exactly like it does now!</p> 
<p>You think back to your training and make a plan: first you'll put everything under a common namespace then, once that basic organization is done, you'll begin adding structure, a little bit each release. Once everything is namespaced, you'll move data out of hidden form elements, replace fragile event handlers with pub/sub, isolate all the plugins you're using, and, if all goes well, upgrade to the latest version of jQuery.</p>
<p>There's just one problem... Your Project Manager has a list of forty features that need to be added to the application. How will you convince your PM to let you do at least a little refactoring in each release?</p>
